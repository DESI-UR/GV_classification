# GV classification

This method is based on the photometric classification developed for Green Valley galaxies as described in my (Kelly Douglass's) PhD thesis, and used in [Douglass & Demina (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10083) and [Ravi, Douglass, & Demina (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11422).
